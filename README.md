Evolutionary-Conservation-of-the-Hemoglobin-Beta-HBB-Gene

Project Overview

The HBB gene encodes a vital component of hemoglobin, which is essential for oxygen transport in the bloodstream.
 This project investigates the evolutionary conservation of the Hemoglobin Beta (HBB) gene across different species, specifically Homo sapiens (humans), Mus musculus (mice), Danio rerio (zebrafish), 
Rattus norvegicus (brown rat), Lagothrix lagotricha (woolly monkey), and Bos taurus (cow).

Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

Perform sequence retrieval using BLAST
Conduct pairwise and multiple sequence alignments
Generate sequence logos to visualize conservation
Construct phylogenetic trees to infer evolutionary relationships
Practice documenting and presenting scientific findings

Methods

The following bioinformatics tools and resources were utilized:

NCBI: For sequence retrieval.
EMBOSS Needle: For pairwise sequence alignment.
ClustalW: For multiple sequence alignment.
Skylign: For generating sequence logos.
MEGA X: For constructing phylogenetic trees.
